# ðŸ‘‘ Treasury
> The Guru Network Bankroll

## Introduction
The Treasury consists of multiple addresses and contracts, which hold various assets, bears liabilities, collects revenues and deploys capital expenditures.

## ELITE is backed by Treasury
[Our token **ELITE**](./elite) is backed by the treasury. Specifically, the Market Cap of ELITE should be generally higher than the worth of Liquid Class-A assets in the treasury. If the mkt. cap. of ELITE becomes lower than this, the treasury may buyback some ELITE tokens by liquidating some of its assets.

{.warning}

The treasury MUST NEVER liquidate its liabilities, such as its Liquid Wrapper's Protocol veNFTs, etc.
