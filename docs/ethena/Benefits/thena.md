# Benefits to Thena.fi ecosystem
There are quite a few things that Guru Network brings to the table:

## Permanent Bribes
The eTHENA protocol has a dedicated 80% of it's net yield for Bribing the stakeholders of Thena DEXâ€Š-â€Šthe veTHE holders.

With eTHENA whitelisted, Thena will gain a permanent briber who is guaranteed to bribe in each and every epoch, irrespective of the market conditions.

## eTHENA Volume = BNB paid to Thena's Voters
Since eTHENA's core pool is with WBNB, the trading volume that takes place will pay the voters with BNB & eTHENA. And this volume is guaranteed by the Kompound Protocol.

## 'Fair Tokenomics' offering infinite scalability
Unlike generic tokens, the supply of eTHENA is not controlled by anyone. It can scale as much as THE itself. There are no "team tokens" or "VC Shares" , and  eTHENA can be minted at will by any THE or veTHE holder, permissionlessly.

## Extending the options for veTHE
eTHENA opens us the conduit for making the Locked veTHE position liquid again. It also relieves the user from the burden of claiming multiple tokens from bribes & trader-fees and subsidises the gas costs by socializing it.

For new users, it offers a no-commitment exposure to the Thena Economy. eTHENA brings purely Real Yield with it, befitting the Solidly approach.

## More liquidity on the Thena books
eTHENA/BNB pool will bring in another liquidity pool to Thena which is guaranteed to generate consistent trade volume, thanks to the ieTHENA Granary.

## The Solidly Experience
Guru Network is the oldest protocol using Solidly. We were the creators of the first solidly gauge on the testnet after Andre & team, and have been quite active in its testing, continuously taking part in improving the Solidly codebase with pulls & its economic model throughout its life & birth. Our token ELITE on Fantom has been participating in the SolidlyWars right from the First Epoch last winter. Today we own nearly 2% of Solidly's circulating supply on Ethereum and have been actively suggesting code improvements to it. We are also the biggest non-partner protocol in it's governance race. We are more equitably involved with the Equalizer exchange, where we helped reshape many of  its facets. Our Solidly Extended Router has been used by multiple Solidly forks & Aggregators to make their ecosystems inclusive to exotic tokens. An alliance with Guru Network greatly benefits Thena in the long run, as we are not here just for the yields, but for developing & mainting the actual Tech that furthers the Decentralization phenomenon.

## And, Beginning of the Thena Wars
We are the first protocol in the governance race of Thena.fi outside of the 19 partners. We believe the whitelisting of eTHENA at  Thena will encourage a lot more smaller and newer protocols to build unique products atop Thena and kickstart an era of collaborative building here.
