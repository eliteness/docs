# Benefits to Liquidity Providers
A major portion of our Net Revenue is dedicated solely to acquiring emissions for our eTHENA pools. As a liquidity provider and farmer in our pools, you gain similar exposure as the native THE farms but with a higher APR!

## What's more?

> Impermanent Loss Protection!

Since eTHENA autocompounds it's rebases, the price of eTHENA grows continuously against normal THE tokens. This provides an added layer of Yield which can boost your earnings as a farmer further and give your position a big hedge against Divergence Risks!
