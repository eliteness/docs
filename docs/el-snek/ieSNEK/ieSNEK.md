# ielSNEK
Interest-bearing elSNEK, generated by the Kompound Protocol.

## Kompound Protocol
Home to the Original Granaries & GRAIN tokens, the Kompound Protocol is a multi-chain yield compounder created by the Guru Network in 2021 on Fantom.

Today its the 3rd biggest on Metis & the Kucoin chains and a leading platform on multiple smaller blockchains.

## ielSNEK: A Special GRAIN
GRAINs are receipt tokens of our compounder. Their redemption price increases continuously as the generated yield gets reinvested to purchase more base tokens for the depositors.

Our users will be able to deposit their elSNEK tokens at the Kompound Protocol on Binance SmartChain. This Granary will stake the elSNEK to earn BNB, and use that to procure more elSNEK from the DEX & compound it back.

## Dual-layer compounding
This would be a doubly-compounding experience for our users, with the first layer of compounding coming from the Rebases onto elSNEK and the second layer from the compounding of BNB back into more elSNEK.

### Why don't we compound all yield at once?
Different users have differing preferences! elSNEK Protocol lets everyone craft their own strategy.
- **SNEK maxis**‚Ää-‚Ääwho want the highest yield per unit SNEK.
- **Real Yield enthusiasts**‚Ää-‚Ääwho prefer earnings & profits paid out regularly in AVAX.
