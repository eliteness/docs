# ielRETRO
Interest-bearing El Retro, generated by the Kompound Protocol.

## Kompound Protocol
Home to the Original Granaries & GRAIN tokens, the Kompound Protocol is a multi-chain yield compounder created by the Guru Network in 2021 on Fantom.

Today its the 3rd biggest on Metis & the Kucoin chains and a leading platform on multiple smaller blockchains.

## ielRETRO: A Special GRAIN
GRAINs are receipt tokens of our compounder. Their redemption price increases continuously as the generated yield gets reinvested to purchase more base tokens for the depositors.

Our users will be able to deposit their El Retro tokens at the Kompound Protocol. This Granary will stake the El Retro to earn MATIC, and use that to procure more El Retro from the DEX & compound it back.

## Dual-layer compounding
This would be a doubly-compounding experience for our users, with the first layer of compounding coming from the Rebases onto El Retro and the second layer from the compounding of MATIC back into more El Retro.

### Why don't we compound all yield at once?
Different users have differing preferences! El Retro Protocol lets everyone craft their own strategy.
- **Retro maxis**â€Š-â€Šwho want the highest yield per unit RETRO.
- **Real Yield enthusiasts**â€Š-â€Šwho prefer earnings & profits paid out regularly in MATIC.
