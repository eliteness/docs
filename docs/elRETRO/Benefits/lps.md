# Benefits to Liquidity Providers
A major portion of our Net Revenue is dedicated solely to acquiring emissions for our elRETRO pools. As a liquidity provider and farmer in our pools, you gain similar exposure as the native RETRO farms but with a higher APR!

## What's more?

> Impermanent Loss Protection!

Since elRETRO autocompounds it's rebases, the price of elRETRO grows continuously against normal RETRO tokens. This provides an added layer of Yield which can boost your earnings as a farmer further and give your position a big hedge against Divergence Risks!
