# The Launch
ELITE is a fixed supply token which had a maximum supply of 1337 when it was born on 17th May, 2021 on Fantom. It had a 1.337% tax on transfer which would continuosly burn it, reducing it's maximum supply.

### Initial Liquidity
133.7 ELITE tokens were added along with FTM into a liquidity pool on SpookySwap to ensure a fair launch without any fundraisers.

Soon thereafter, another 133.7 ELITE tokens were added along with FTM into a liquidity pool, but this time on the SushiSwap DEX.

### 100% Liquidity Token Burn
> Rug-proof!

On the third day, the entire supply of the LP-tokens representing the-then circulating supply of 267.4 ELITE were Burned, including both the SpookyLP & SushiLP tokens.

## Supply Cap
During the second month after its launch, the community decided to limit the supply of ELITE token to 250 tokens only.

Since then, the Circulating supply of ELITE has been fixed at 250 ELITE tokens.
