# Core mechanism

## Summary
- Users can convert their veNFT into elSNEK.
- elSNEK can be staked to earn AVAX.
- ielSNEK is a dedicated compounder for elSNEK.

## Minting elSNEK
Initially in the first week, each 1 SNEK inside a veNFT will be able to mint out 1 elSNEK (1:1 ratio).

### Minting-price Ratio & Rebases
As the epochs go by the rewards from rebasing will be added to the main veNFT of elSNEK protocol without minting any new elSNEK. This will cause the minting ratio to shift from 1:1 to 1:(1+R), R being the rebase factor.

> For example, if the rebase for 2nd epoch is 0.5%, then the mint ratio will increase to 1.005, which means it would take a veNFT with 1.005 SNEK inside it to mint 1 elSNEK token.

Due the fact that there are no negative rebases in veSNEK system, this minting-price ratio of elSNEK will keep on increasing forever, and it will keep on appreciating against plain SNEK in a veNFT.

## Usage of the veNFT
The main veNFT of the system will be simply used to maximize the returns from voting. Vote distribution will only consider the after-sale value (in AVAX) of the earnable Bribes & Voter fees to decide its vote.

All the earnings from Voting such as Bribes & Trade-fee will be sold in their entireity to purchase AVAX.

All 100% of the Votes will be used for this purpose and this purpose only. Even if we have a conflict of interests in the future, the votes will be allocated solely on the basis of maximum AVAX returns per vote.

## Usage of the AVAX from Voting yield
- 13.37% of the AVAX will be used to acquire Protocol-owned Liquidity.
- 86.63% of the AVAX is used as follows:
	- 20% of AVAX is distributed to Stakers
	- 80% of AVAX is sent as Bribes to SoliSnek.finance voters
