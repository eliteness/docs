- how long should i lock scusd on rings to get veusd to mint eliteusd?
> any duration lock is fine, you get the Liquid Wrapper, while the underlying you give up to elite gets maxlocked

- is eliteUSD a stablecoin?
> yeah think of it as a stablecoin, its not super stable at $1, and can go under, but the idea is you get to unlock USDC from it over a 1 year unlock period, while earning the yield.
> if you are familiar with PTs from pendle, its a similar tokenomic setup.
> its minted with locked scUSD, which can be unlocked over a year if selling it gives a bad price.

- what if it depegs?
> the 1 year unlock is the backup mechanism which underpins the price/peg/ratio, which is basically market's perception of its yield. like buying 1 eliteUSD for $0.9 means you get $1 after a year = 10% apr after a year, guaranteed. so akin to buying PTs on Spectra/Pendle/etc.
> but holding eliteUSD would pay yield as well so quite a market dynamic there, which prices in as a premium to make it as close to $1 as possible

- whats the partner program?
> anyone can partner with us to get a proportional share of our rewards, basically think of it like 10m eliteusd supply earns 2m a year. your pool has 500k eliteusd (5% of total supply), so it gets about 5% of the earnings = $100k a year,
> common themes: pair your token with eliteusd in a LP, **we pay you directly, weekly** based on how much minimum eliteUSD your pool held during the week.
> alternatively, we can also LP bribe or Vote bribe to make the most out of this!

- can eliteUSD price go higher that $1?
> yep, its designed to go up only, similar to ethena :ethena:
> Mint fees and redeem fees compound back into the ever-increasing mint ratio, which props up the inherent valuation as scUSD backing per eliteUSD goes up only.

- does it rebase?
> it does rebase, but not from the yield, but from the fees.
> As a result, the scUSD backing per 1 eliteRingsScUSD goes up only.
> Same is reflected in the Minting Ratio!
