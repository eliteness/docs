# ðŸŽ¨ Brand & Media Kit

## General Guidelines

We recommend using our NEW ELITE Token Icon "â‰¢" to denote the Eliteness.Network parent protocol, as well as for ELITE token.

For individual protocols, please use their own icons & logos.

If needed, add a 40% x 40% inset Circlular ELITE icon at the any of the 4 corners of our Child Protocol's logo to denote the relationship.
For example, to show eTHENA, you could either use just eTHENA's logo, or use its logo with an inset ELITE icon in a circle at the bottom-right corner.

## Brand Color is #001337
`0x001337` or `#001337` is our Hex Code. This is Dark Navy Blue. Use a Level-`AAA` color such as Full White `#FFFFFFFF` with it for contrast, as recommended in [WCAG21](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced).

## Protcol Logos & Token Logos

We store our logos in the [`@ftm1337/icons`](https://github.com/ftm1337/icons) repository.

Token logos are also stored in [`@funified-defi/equalizer-tokens`](https://github.com/unified-defi/equalizer-tokens) repository.

To find a token's logo, locate its chain's directory & then find its address.
