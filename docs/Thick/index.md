## 1) What?
Thick introduces the concept of Protocol-Agnostic Concentrated Liquidity into DeFi, empowering it to Distribute shared, Flywheeled self-incentivising, Concentrated Liquidity across a multitude of plugged-in protocols.

## A Public Good
Thick aims to be a shared infrastructure for liquidity, being utilized by multiple protocols at once. It enables fee-sharing among individual providers strictly based on their contribution to the whole, which has a beautiful effect of expanding their returns due a Network-effect kicking in magnified Trade activity!

## Plug-and-Play!
Thick can be used by anyone or any Protocol to setup their Solidly-like Flywheel, enabling any new or existing Liquidity Incentivizing project to tap into a pre-established Liquidity Layer that has already been pre-integrated with the DeFi network of DEX Aggregators, Arbitrageurs and High-frequency Trading networks.

This provides the integrating platform with access to all the features of a prominent Liquidity Layer from Day 1, without the hassle of chasing other protocols for individual integrations.

## Automated Range Managers
Thick has already been integrated with multiple ALM (Automated Liquidity Management) protocols which streamline the process of Concentrated Liquidity management for end-users.

Our ALMs also make it easy for Projects to start earning back revenue from our LP incentivization Flywheel. Projects can start taking up ALM's CLP receipts as deposits and earn the full share of Trade Fees generated from this CLP. This helps the Project to rake in Real Revenue that offsets its emissions, making it more sustaibable in the long run.

Thanks to our special Fee-Synthesizers, this process of Revenue collection can also be automated, and can be used for novel revenue sharing mechanisms such as forwarding it (or a part of it) to the integrating Project's users, in form of Staking Rewards, external incentives at some other protocol, or even as bribes to their veToken holders, or in any other exotic tokenomic dimension!
