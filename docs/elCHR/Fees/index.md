# Protocol Fees
**13.37%** of all earnings (after conversion to WETH) from the Protocol veNFT will be treated as 'Protocol Fees'.

It can be broadly classified into 2 sections:
- Protocol-owned Liquidity
- Performance Fees

## Protocol-owned Liquidity
Half of the 13.37% of ETH will buyback elCHR from the market and be matched with the other half to create liquidity tokens of the elCHR/WETH pair at Chronos DEX.




## Performance Fees
The PoL allocation will be transitioned partially into Performance Fees during the later


### Early phase
Initially, there will be no direct fees taken out of the system by the Guru Network. All of the 13.37% will be allocated towards acquiring Protocol-owned Liquidity.
- There will be Zero Performance fee initially for atleast 2â€“4 months.

### Future
Once the system matures enough and there is sufficient liquidity, a part of the ETH from the recurring 13.37% funding allocated for PoL building will be sent to our treasury as performance fee.
- Performance fee is capped at a max of 13.37% of ETH earnings.
- This fees can only be taken from the PoL allocations.
