# Benefits to Liquidity Providers

A major portion of our Net Revenue is dedicated solely to acquiring emissions for our ELR (El Ramses) pools. As a liquidity provider and farmer in our pools, you gain similar exposure as the native RAM farms but with a higher APR!

## What's more?

> Impermanent Loss Protection!

Since ELR (El Ramses) autocompounds it's rebases, the price of ELR (El Ramses) grows continuously against normal RAM tokens. This provides an added layer of Yield which can boost your earnings as a farmer further and give your position a big hedge against Divergence Risks!
